## Biomedical Instrumentation

**Project description:** Graduate level course taught by Dr. Nitish Thakor. Learning the principles of design of biomedical instrumentation including sensors, biometric monitoring, wearables, photoplethesmography, BCI, prosthetics, and more. Lab component involved creating ECG amplifiers and EMG recording circuits. Projects created within 3-week timeline.

### Wearable Posture Sensor

I created a wearable posture sensor for detection slouching or kyphosis. The novel object here overcomes the limitations of prior art through the following constituent elements: integration into athletic garments or stretch sensing fabrics, real-time feedback appropriate to the approximate level of bending, multiple sensors to detect changes in posture as a body unit, shoulder placement in addition to spine, additional inertial measurement unit to detect primary axial change in forward or back tilt, multi-inch sensor transducer along entire spine, secondary feedback with LED on front of garment, and multiple feedback points of vibrational motor on each shoulder. Mainly, the feedback mechanism of this technology has purposeful continuous feedback. While prior art includes single buzz of one motor, this technology has multiple vibrational motors that will vibrate and continue to vibrate until the posture deviation is corrected. In this way, the user is ensured to make correction. 


### Smart Shoes for the Visually Impaired

We created a novel system for aiding the visually impaired with obstacle detection. This is in the form of a pair of technology enhanced smart shoes. The shoes are fitted with multiple ultrasonic distance sensors that measure the distance of an object through sound wave travel. Ultrasonic sensors are known to have a long range of sensing and are inexpensive, compared to other types of sensors, such as radar or infrared/optical. The smart shoes provide feedback to the wearer on objects in close proximity. <br>
