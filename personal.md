Born and raised in the Greater Seattle area, Zina attended Santa Clara University where she majored in Bioengineering. She participated in many extracurricular activities, including BMES, SWE, and Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. After graduating Cum Laude, she started at Biosense Webster, a Johnson and Johnson company. She completed her Associate program within six months, and signed off as a certified Clinical Specialist for the Bay Area field region. The CAS role is unique in that in addition to traditional "rep" duties, the CAS is intimately involved with daily case procedures. The CAS works in a minute-by-minute fashion in coordination with the Electrophysiologist throughout the procedure, offering spatial navigation and product reference. After three years at BWI, she pursued a technical Masters degree in Biomedial Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
