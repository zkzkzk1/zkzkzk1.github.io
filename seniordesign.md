### Undergraduate Senior Design Project

#### Phosphate Contaminant Detection in Water through Electrochemical Biosensor
My senior thesis was to investigate a portable water contaminant detection device. Since affected areas mainly comprise of developing nations, there is a need for an affordable and user-friendly phosphate testing platform. With our research, we presented an affordable, rapid, user-friendly, and sensitive electrochemical phosphate sensor that has the ability to test water samples and provide immediate nutrient diagnosis. The year-long research project involved the entire design process: identifying user needs, design inputs, selection, design outputs and prototyping, testing, iteration, manufacturing, and writing grants, reports and presentations. <br>
