#### Phosphate Contaminant Detection in Water through Electrochemical Biosensor
To combat the issue of phosphate contamination, widespread testing is necessary in affected areas, however current testing methods are expensive, off-site and time consuming. Since affected areas mainly comprise of developing nations, there is a need for an affordable and user-friendly phosphate testing platform. With our research, we present an affordable, rapid, user-friendly, and sensitive electrochemical phosphate sensor that has the ability to test water samples and provide immediate nutrient diagnosis.<br>
