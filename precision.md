## Precision Care Medicine

**Project description:** Graduate level course taught by Dr. Raimond Winslow in the Institute for Computational Medicine. <br>
 Precision Care Medicine is a combined project and lecture course, with projects proposed by faculty of the Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) Department and their collaborators.

### Predicting Respiratory Decompensation in the ICU using Machine Learning Models
I led a team of five graduate students in a year-long project, collaborating with Clinical faculty advisors and Engineering advisors.

Mechanical ventilation is a critical and often life-saving treatment required by patients with insufficient oxygenation. However, during mechanical ventilation treatment, a patientis at risk for developing a respiratory decompensation. This is called a VAC, Ventilator Associated Complication. We would like to develop a predictive, early-warning model for respiratory decompensation.

My team built a predictive model for the likelihood of ventilator associated complications in ICU patients. In order to achieve this result, we leveraged data from an open-access database and utilize machine learning techniques to evaluate the information. The data was EHR, medical record, clinical nursing notes, and vital signs medium frequency data. Our results have the potential to inform clinicians about critical interventions during the ICU stay of mechanically ventilated patients.
