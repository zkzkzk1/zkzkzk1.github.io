## Precision Care Medicine

**Project description:** Graduate level course taught by Dr. Raimond Winslow in the Institute for Computational Medicine. <br>
 Precision Care Medicine is a combined project and lecture course, with projects proposed by faculty of the Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) Department and their collaborators.

### Predicting Respiratory Decompensation in the ICU using Generalized Linear Models
I am leading a team of five graduate students in a year-long project, collaborating with Clinical faculty advisors and Engineering advisors.

Mechanical ventilation is a critical and often life-saving treatment required by patients with insufficient oxygenation. However, during mechanical ventilation treatment, a patientis at risk for developing a respiratory decompensation. This is called a VAC, Ventilator Associated Complication. A VAC not only lengthens a patient’s ICU stay and thus exacerbates the monetary burden on these individuals, but a VAC also doubles a patient’s mortality rate and increases the risk of comorbidity complications. A clinically significant early warning of decompensation could trigger investigations and interventions that may minimize these risks. Lack of access to large-scale clinical patient and electronic patient records and the vague definition of respiratory decompensation have likely hindered the creation of a predictive model to date. The current techniques used for critical care assessment are insufficient to predict mechanical ventilation related events before a physician detects obvious biological signs of a VAC.
We would like to develop a predictive, early-warning model for respiratory decompensation.

Our goal is to build a predictive model for the likelihood of ventilator associated complications in ICU patients. In order to achieve this result, we will leverage data from an open-access database and utilize machine learning techniques to evaluate the information. Our results have the potential to inform clinicians about critical interventions during the ICU stay ofmechanically ventilated patients. 
The model will calculate a risk score for likelihood to enter the disease state. With a clinically significant early warning system on the order of six hours, the monitoring physician will have this risk score, in addition to other normal variables, as evidence to make changes to treatment protocol if necessary. Clinicians will be able to better attend to patients before the obvious signs of decompensation.
